This is a "building AI course project"

## Summary
When painting your house indoor, you can choose between many different colors. But what color should you choose? Which color will suite your apartment/house, based on other colors in your house, like your funiture and the color of the floor? An AI tool can be built by accessing your camera on your mobile device. You will be able to choose between "filters" , with universal color codes, so that you can get an idea of how various colors will look like in your house, before painting. Recommendations will be given to you based on what colors that go together, or what colors that are most trendy right now, or what kind of "mood" you want to achieve.



## Background

We spend most of our time in our home. Our home is a place to relax and gather friends and family. Living in a home, where you feel at home, where you can feel relaxed and energized, will perhaps enhance your life quality. One of the things you can do to create a cozy, personal home is to paint it. But what color should you choose? When painting a house or an apartment indoor, it is often difficult to imagine how the color will look like in your house in real life. You might want to refresh your house, perhaps before selling it, to increase the value. You want to be confident that the colors will look great in your apartment, based on other colors in your house, like furniture, or other paintings, or the color of the floor and ceiling, perhaps you would like to paint rooms in different colors. Perhaps you want to achieve a specific "mood", like "bright", "cozy", "relaxing", "energizing", or perhaps you would like to choose what is trendy right now, in your local area, or perhaps in another country. 

*What color should you choose for your home?
*How will different colors look like in your home?
*What colors go together?
*What colors do not go together?
*What colors are trendy right now?
*What colors are trendy in a specific country, or correlates with a specific style you want to achieve?
*What "effect" or "mood" do you want to acchieve?
*What painting label should you choose, based on availability, price, recommendations, allergy and asthma-friendly products, environmentally friendly products, etc?

 

## How is it used?

Choosing the right color and label on the painting will potentially reduce the impact on the environment. It will decrease negative impact on your health by suggesting available environmentally and health-friendly products. By enabling you to see how a color will look like, it will help you to choose the right color and label from start, so that you don't have to paint over again. By filtering products based on price, it will help you to save money, or perhaps increase the life span, because you chose the painting of a greater quality. If you plan to sell your house, you will be more aware of what colors that most people like, so that it will increase your chances of resail, and perhaps also increase the price of your house.

The users may be both individuals, as well as companies that are planning to paint their offices/locations. Having "fresh" colors may increase the wellbeing of the coworkers or customers.

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
