Choosing painting in your house

## Summary
When painting your house indoor, you can choose between many colours. Which colour will suite your apartment/house, based on other colours in your house (like funiture)? An tool can be built by accessing your camera on your mobile device. Filters of colours can be shown, so that you can get an idea of how it will look like in your house, before painting. Recommendations will be given to you based on what colours that go together, or what colours that are most trendy tight now, or what colours that you should avoid.

This is a "building AI course project"


## Background

We spend most of our time in our home. Your home is a place to relax, gather friends and family, study, work, sleep, eat, etc. Living in a home, where you feel at home, will probably enhance your life quality. One of the things you can do in ypur home, is to paint it. But what colour should you chosse? When painting a house or an apartment indoor, it is often difficult to imagine how the colour will look like in your house in real life. You might want to refresh your house, perhaps before selling it. You want to be confident that the colours will look great in your apartment, based on other colours in your hpuse, like funiture, or other paintings. Perhaps you would like to paint rooms in different colours. Perhaps ypu want to achieve a specific feeling or feautre, like "bright", "cosy", "relaxing", "energizing" og what is trendy right now. 

*What colour should you choose for your home?
*How will different colours look like in your home?
*What colours go together?
*What colours do not go together?
*What colours are trendy right now?
*What "effect" do you want to acchieve?



## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
